Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.\\n1 Introduction\\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\\nmachine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\\nor less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\\nany signiﬁcant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\\nWith progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\\ncomplex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\\nthe most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\\nnetwork based language models signiﬁcantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\\n1.1 Goals of the Paper\\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word\\nvectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary.

This has been observed earlier in the context\\nof inﬂectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\\nsimilar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to ﬁnd words that have similar\\nendings [13, 14].\\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\\nsyntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\\nformed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vec-\\ntor(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the wordQueen [20].\\nIn this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model\\narchitectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test\\nset for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities 1, and show that many such regularities\\ncan be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends\\non the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.\\n1.2 Previous Work\\nRepresentation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [10, 26, 8]. A very popular model\\narchitecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [1], where a\\nfeedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to\\nlearn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been\\nfollowed by many others.\\nAnother interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [13, 14], where the word vectors are\\nﬁrst learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train\\nthe NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this\\nwork, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the ﬁrst step where the word vectors are\\nlearned using a simple model.\\nIt was later shown that the word vectors can be used to signiﬁcantly improve and simplify many\\nNLP applications [4, 5, 29]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different\\nmodel architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 29, 23, 19, 9], and some of the resulting word\\nvectors were made available for future research and comparison2. However, as far as we know, these\\narchitectures were signiﬁcantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed\\nin [13], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices\\nare used [23].\\n2 Model Architectures\\nMany different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,\\nincluding the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\\nIn this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was\\npreviously shown that they perform signiﬁcantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities\\namong words [20, 31]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\\nSimilar to [18], to compare different model architectures we deﬁne ﬁrst the computational complex-\\nity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next,\\nwe will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.\\n1The test set is available at www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/word-test.v1.txt\\n2http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/\\nhttp://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/\\nhttp://www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/\\nhttp://ai.stanford.edu/˜ehhuang/\\n2'),\n",

Common choice is E = 3− 50 and T up to one billion.\\nAll models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation [26].\\n2.1 Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)\\nThe probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [1]. It consists\\nof input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, N previous words are encoded\\nusing 1-of- V coding, where V is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a\\nprojection layer P that has dimensionality N × D, using a shared projection matrix. As only N\\ninputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation.\\nThe NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden\\nlayer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N = 10, the size of the\\nprojection layer (P) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size H is typically 500 to 1000\\nunits. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the\\nvocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionalityV . Thus, the computational complexity\\nper each training example is\\nQ = N × D + N × D × H + H × V, (2)\\nwhere the dominating term is H × V . However, several practical solutions were proposed for\\navoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax [25, 23, 18], or avoiding normalized\\nmodels completely by using models that are not normalized during training [4, 9]. With binary tree\\nrepresentations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down\\nto around log2(V ). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N × D × H.\\nIn our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary\\ntree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes\\nin neural net language models [16]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and\\nthis further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree\\nwould require log2(V ) outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires\\nonly about log2(Unigram perplexity(V )). For example when the vocabulary size is one million\\nwords, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for\\nneural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in theN ×D×H term, we will later propose\\narchitectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efﬁciency of the softmax\\nnormalization.\\n2.2 Recurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)\\nRecurrent neural network based language model has been proposed to overcome certain limitations\\nof the feedforward NNLM, such as the need to specify the context length (the order of the modelN),\\nand because theoretically RNNs can efﬁciently represent more complex patterns than the shallow\\nneural networks [15, 2]. The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and\\noutput layer. What is special for this type of model is the recurrent matrix that connects hidden\\nlayer to itself, using time-delayed connections. This allows the recurrent model to form some kind\\nof short term memory, as information from the past can be represented by the hidden layer state that\\ngets updated based on the current input and the state of the hidden layer in the previous time step.\\nThe complexity per training example of the RNN model is\\nQ = H × H + H × V, (3)\\nwhere the word representations D have the same dimensionality as the hidden layer H. Again, the\\nterm H × V can be efﬁciently reduced to H × log2(V ) by using hierarchical softmax. Most of the\\ncomplexity then comes from H × H.\\n3'),\n",

The framework allows us to run multiple replicas of the same model in\\nparallel, and each replica synchronizes its gradient updates through a centralized server that keeps\\nall the parameters. For this parallel training, we use mini-batch asynchronous gradient descent with\\nan adaptive learning rate procedure called Adagrad [7]. Under this framework, it is common to use\\none hundred or more model replicas, each using many CPU cores at different machines in a data\\ncenter.\\n3 New Log-linear Models\\nIn this section, we propose two new model architectures for learning distributed representations\\nof words that try to minimize computational complexity. The main observation from the previous\\nsection was that most of the complexity is caused by the non-linear hidden layer in the model. While\\nthis is what makes neural networks so attractive, we decided to explore simpler models that might\\nnot be able to represent the data as precisely as neural networks, but can possibly be trained on much\\nmore data efﬁciently.\\nThe new architectures directly follow those proposed in our earlier work [13, 14], where it was\\nfound that neural network language model can be successfully trained in two steps: ﬁrst, continuous\\nword vectors are learned using simple model, and then the N-gram NNLM is trained on top of these\\ndistributed representations of words. While there has been later substantial amount of work that\\nfocuses on learning word vectors, we consider the approach proposed in [13] to be the simplest one.\\nNote that related models have been proposed also much earlier [26, 8].\\n3.1 Continuous Bag-of-Words Model\\nThe ﬁrst proposed architecture is similar to the feedforward NNLM, where the non-linear hidden\\nlayer is removed and the projection layer is shared for all words (not just the projection matrix);\\nthus, all words get projected into the same position (their vectors are averaged). We call this archi-\\ntecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not inﬂuence the projection.\\nFurthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task\\nintroduced in the next section by building a log-linear classiﬁer with four future and four history\\nwords at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word.\\nTraining complexity is then\\nQ = N × D + D × log2(V ). (4)\\nWe denote this model further as CBOW, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous\\ndistributed representation of the context. The model architecture is shown at Figure 1. Note that the\\nweight matrix between the input and the projection layer is shared for all word positions in the same\\nway as in the NNLM.\\n3.2 Continuous Skip-gram Model\\nThe second architecture is similar to CBOW, but instead of predicting the current word based on the\\ncontext, it tries to maximize classiﬁcation of a word based on another word in the same sentence.\\nMore precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classiﬁer with continuous\\nprojection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We\\nfound that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases\\nthe computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current\\nword than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those\\nwords in our training examples.\\nThe training complexity of this architecture is proportional to\\nQ = C × (D + D × log2(V )), (5)\\nwhere C is the maximum distance of the words. Thus, if we choose C = 5, for each training word\\nwe will select randomly a number R in range < 1; C >, and then use R words from history and\\n4'),\n",

In the\\nfollowing experiments, we use C = 10.\\n4 Results\\nTo compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table\\nshowing example words and their most similar words, and understand them intuitively. Although\\nit is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much\\nmore challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We\\nfollow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for\\nexample, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example\\nof another type of relationship can be word pairs big - biggest and small - smallest [20]. We further\\ndenote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: ”What is the\\nword that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?”\\nSomewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations\\nwith the vector representation of words. To ﬁnd a word that is similar to small in the same sense as\\nbiggest is similar to big, we can simply compute vectorX = vector(”biggest”) −vector(”big”) +\\nvector(”small”). Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest toX measured by cosine\\ndistance, and use it as the answer to the question (we discard the input question words during this\\nsearch). When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to ﬁnd the correct answer (word\\nsmallest) using this method.\\nFinally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the\\nresulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as\\na city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors\\nwith such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such\\nas machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other\\nfuture applications yet to be invented.\\n5'),\n",

Two examples from each category are\\nshown in Table 1. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions\\nin each category were created in two steps: ﬁrst, a list of similar word pairs was created manually.\\nThen, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a\\nlist of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by\\npicking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus\\nmulti-word entities are not present (such as New York).\\nWe evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (se-\\nmantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the\\nvector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question;\\nsynonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100% accuracy is likely\\nto be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology.\\nHowever, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively\\ncorrelated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information\\nabout structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions.\\n4.2 Maximization of Accuracy\\nWe have used a Google News corpus for training the word vectors. This corpus contains about\\n6B tokens. We have restricted the vocabulary size to 1 million most frequent words. Clearly, we\\nare facing time constrained optimization problem, as it can be expected that both using more data\\nand higher dimensional word vectors will improve the accuracy. To estimate the best choice of\\nmodel architecture for obtaining as good as possible results quickly, we have ﬁrst evaluated models\\ntrained on subsets of the training data, with vocabulary restricted to the most frequent 30k words.\\nThe results using the CBOW architecture with different choice of word vector dimensionality and\\nincreasing amount of the training data are shown in Table 2.\\nIt can be seen that after some point, adding more dimensions or adding more training data provides\\ndiminishing improvements. So, we have to increase both vector dimensionality and the amount\\nof the training data together.

We chose starting learning rate 0.025 and decreased it linearly, so\\nthat it approaches zero at the end of the last training epoch.\\n4.3 Comparison of Model Architectures\\nFirst we compare different model architectures for deriving the word vectors using the same training\\ndata and using the same dimensionality of 640 of the word vectors. In the further experiments, we\\nuse full set of questions in the new Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, i.e. unrestricted to\\nthe 30k vocabulary. We also include results on a test set introduced in [20] that focuses on syntactic\\nsimilarity between words3.\\nThe training data consists of several LDC corpora and is described in detail in [18] (320M words,\\n82K vocabulary). We used these data to provide a comparison to a previously trained recurrent\\nneural network language model that took about 8 weeks to train on a single CPU. We trained a feed-\\nforward NNLM with the same number of 640 hidden units using the DistBelief parallel training [6],\\nusing a history of 8 previous words (thus, the NNLM has more parameters than the RNNLM, as the\\nprojection layer has size 640 × 8).\\nIn Table 3, it can be seen that the word vectors from the RNN (as used in [20]) perform well mostly\\non the syntactic questions. The NNLM vectors perform signiﬁcantly better than the RNN - this is\\nnot surprising, as the word vectors in the RNNLM are directly connected to a non-linear hidden\\nlayer. The CBOW architecture works better than the NNLM on the syntactic tasks, and about the\\nsame on the semantic one. Finally, the Skip-gram architecture works slightly worse on the syntactic\\ntask than the CBOW model (but still better than the NNLM), and much better on the semantic part\\nof the test than all the other models.\\nNext, we evaluated our models trained using one CPU only and compared the results against publicly\\navailable word vectors. The comparison is given in Table 4. The CBOW model was trained on subset\\n3We thank Geoff Zweig for providing us the test set.\\n7'),\n",

This task consists of 1040 sentences, where one\\nword is missing in each sentence and the goal is to select word that is the most coherent with the\\nrest of the sentence, given a list of ﬁve reasonable choices. Performance of several techniques has\\nbeen already reported on this set, including N-gram models, LSA-based model [32], log-bilinear\\nmodel [24] and a combination of recurrent neural networks that currently holds the state of the art\\nperformance of 55.4% accuracy on this benchmark [19].\\nWe have explored the performance of Skip-gram architecture on this task. First, we train the 640-\\ndimensional model on 50M words provided in [32]. Then, we compute score of each sentence in\\nthe test set by using the unknown word at the input, and predict all surrounding words in a sentence.\\nThe ﬁnal sentence score is then the sum of these individual predictions. Using the sentence scores,\\nwe choose the most likely sentence.\\nA short summary of some previous results together with the new results is presented in Table 7.\\nWhile the Skip-gram model itself does not perform on this task better than LSA similarity, the scores\\nfrom this model are complementary to scores obtained with RNNLMs, and a weighted combination\\nleads to a new state of the art result 58.9% accuracy (59.2% on the development part of the set and\\n58.7% on the test part of the set).\\n5 Examples of the Learned Relationships\\nTable 8 shows words that follow various relationships. We follow the approach described above: the\\nrelationship is deﬁned by subtracting two word vectors, and the result is added to another word. Thus\\nfor example, Paris - France + Italy = Rome .

Clearly, there is still a lot of discoveries to be made using these techniques.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper we studied the quality of vector representations of words derived by various models on\\na collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks. We observed that it is possible to train high\\nquality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network\\nmodels (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it\\nis possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.\\nUsing the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram\\nmodels even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That\\nis several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.\\nAn interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the\\nprevious state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [11]. The publicly available RNN vectors were\\nused together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman’s rank correlation\\nover the previous best result [31]. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied\\nto many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [12] and paraphrase detection [28]. It can\\nbe expected that these applications can beneﬁt from the model architectures described in this paper.\\nOur ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension\\nof facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for veriﬁcation of correctness of existing facts. Results\\nfrom machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\\ninteresting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\\nour comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\\nestimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\\nbuilding block for future NLP applications.\\n10'),\n",

Instead, we frame object detection as a re-\\ngression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and\\nassociated class probabilities. A single neural network pre-\\ndicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from\\nfull images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection\\npipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end\\ndirectly on detection performance.\\nOur uniﬁed architecture is extremely fast. Our base\\nYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames\\nper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,\\nprocesses an astounding 155 frames per second while\\nstill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-\\ntors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO\\nmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predict\\nfalse positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very\\ngeneral representations of objects. It outperforms other de-\\ntection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when gener-\\nalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.\\n1. Introduction\\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-\\njects are in the image, where they are, and how they inter-\\nact. The human visual system is fast and accurate, allow-\\ning us to perform complex tasks like driving with little con-\\nscious thought. Fast, accurate algorithms for object detec-\\ntion would allow computers to drive cars without special-\\nized sensors, enable assistive devices to convey real-time\\nscene information to human users, and unlock the potential\\nfor general purpose, responsive robotic systems.\\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classiﬁers to per-\\nform detection. To detect an object, these systems take a\\nclassiﬁer for that object and evaluate it at various locations\\nand scales in a test image. Systems like deformable parts\\nmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the\\nclassiﬁer is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire\\nimage [10].\\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\\n1.

After\\nclassiﬁcation, post-processing is used to reﬁne the bound-\\ning boxes, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore the\\nboxes based on other objects in the scene [13]. These com-\\nplex pipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each\\nindividual component must be trained separately.\\nWe reframe object detection as a single regression prob-\\nlem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-\\nnates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only\\nlook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are\\npresent and where they are.\\nYOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-\\ngle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-\\nple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.\\nYOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-\\ntion performance. This uniﬁed model has several beneﬁts\\nover traditional methods of object detection.\\nFirst, YOLO is extremely fast. Since we frame detection\\nas a regression problem we don’t need a complex pipeline.\\nWe simply run our neural network on a new image at test\\ntime to predict detections. Our base network runs at 45\\nframes per second with no batch processing on a Titan X\\nGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This\\nmeans we can process streaming video in real-time with\\nless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO\\nachieves more than twice the mean average precision of\\nother real-time systems.

Unlike sliding window and region\\nproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image\\nduring training and test time so it implicitly encodes contex-\\ntual information about classes as well as their appearance.\\nFast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes back-\\nground patches in an image for objects because it can’t see\\nthe larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number\\nof background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-\\njects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-\\nwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM\\nand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-\\neralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to\\nnew domains or unexpected inputs.\\nYOLO still lags behind state-of-the-art detection systems\\nin accuracy. While it can quickly identify objects in im-\\nages it struggles to precisely localize some objects, espe-\\ncially small ones. We examine these tradeoffs further in our\\nexperiments.\\nAll of our training and testing code is open source. A\\nvariety of pretrained models are also available to download.\\n2. Uniﬁed Detection\\nWe unify the separate components of object detection\\ninto a single neural network. Our network uses features\\nfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It also\\npredicts all bounding boxes across all classes for an im-\\nage simultaneously. This means our network reasons glob-\\nally about the full image and all the objects in the image.\\nThe YOLO design enables end-to-end training and real-\\ntime speeds while maintaining high average precision.\\nOur system divides the input image into an S×S grid.\\nIf the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell\\nis responsible for detecting that object.\\nEach grid cell predictsBbounding boxes and conﬁdence\\nscores for those boxes. These conﬁdence scores reﬂect how\\nconﬁdent the model is that the box contains an object and\\nalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-\\nmally we deﬁne conﬁdence as Pr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred . If no\\nobject exists in that cell, the conﬁdence scores should be\\nzero. Otherwise we want the conﬁdence score to equal the\\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box\\nand the ground truth.\\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x, y, w, h,\\nand conﬁdence. The (x,y) coordinates represent the center\\nof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width\\nand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally\\nthe conﬁdence prediction represents the IOU between the\\npredicted box and any ground truth box.\\nEach grid cell also predicts C conditional class proba-\\nbilities, Pr(Classi|Object). These probabilities are condi-\\ntioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predict\\none set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the\\nnumber of boxes B.\\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\\nties and the individual box conﬁdence predictions,\\nPr(Classi|Object) ∗Pr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred = Pr(Classi) ∗IOUtruth\\npred (1)\\nwhich gives us class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each\\nbox. These scores encode both the probability of that class\\nappearing in the box and how well the predicted box ﬁts the\\nobject.\\nS × S grid on input\\nBounding boxes + confidence\\nClass probability map\\nFinal detections\\nFigure 2: The Model.

The full network is\\nshown in Figure 3.\\nWe also train a fast version of YOLO designed to push\\nthe boundaries of fast object detection. Fast YOLO uses a\\nneural network with fewer convolutional layers (9 instead\\nof 24) and fewer ﬁlters in those layers.

Training\\nWe pretrain our convolutional layers on the ImageNet\\n1000-class competition dataset [30]. For pretraining we use\\nthe ﬁrst 20 convolutional layers from Figure 3 followed by a\\naverage-pooling layer and a fully connected layer. We train\\nthis network for approximately a week and achieve a single\\ncrop top-5 accuracy of 88% on the ImageNet 2012 valida-\\ntion set, comparable to the GoogLeNet models in Caffe’s\\nModel Zoo [24]. We use the Darknet framework for all\\ntraining and inference [26].\\nWe then convert the model to perform detection. Ren et\\nal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-\\ners to pretrained networks can improve performance [29].\\nFollowing their example, we add four convolutional lay-\\ners and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized\\nweights. Detection often requires ﬁne-grained visual infor-\\nmation so we increase the input resolution of the network\\nfrom 224 ×224 to 448 ×448.\\nOur ﬁnal layer predicts both class probabilities and\\nbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box\\nwidth and height by the image width and height so that they\\nfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x\\nand ycoordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-\\ntion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\\nWe use a linear activation function for the ﬁnal layer and\\nall other layers use the following leaky rectiﬁed linear acti-\\nvation:\\nφ(x) =\\n{\\nx, if x> 0\\n0.1x, otherwise (2)\\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of our\\nmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-\\ntimize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of\\nmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-\\nror equally with classiﬁcation error which may not be ideal.\\nAlso, in every image many grid cells do not contain any\\nobject. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells\\ntowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells\\nthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,\\ncausing training to diverge early on.\\nTo remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding box\\ncoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from conﬁ-\\ndence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. We\\nuse two parameters, λcoord and λnoobj to accomplish this. We\\nset λcoord = 5and λnoobj = .5.\\nSum-squared error also equally weights errors in large\\nboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reﬂect that\\nsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in small\\nboxes. To partially address this we predict the square root\\nof the bounding box width and height instead of the width\\nand height directly.\\nYOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.\\nAt training time we only want one bounding box predictor\\nto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor\\nto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which\\nprediction has the highest current IOU with the ground\\ntruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box\\npredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain\\nsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall\\nrecall.\\nDuring training we optimize the following, multi-part'),\n",

When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007\\ntest data for training. Throughout training we use a batch\\nsize of 64, a momentum of 0.9 and a decay of 0.0005.\\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst\\nepochs we slowly raise the learning rate from10−3 to 10−2.\\nIf we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges\\ndue to unstable gradients. We continue training with 10−2\\nfor 75 epochs, then 10−3 for 30 epochs, and ﬁnally 10−4\\nfor 30 epochs.\\nTo avoid overﬁtting we use dropout and extensive data\\naugmentation.

We\\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\\nage by up to a factor of 1.5 in the HSV color space.\\n2.3. Inference\\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\\nonly requires one network evaluation. On PASCAL VOC the\\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\\nlike classiﬁer-based methods.\\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box for\\neach object. However, some large objects or objects near\\nthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these\\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\\n3% in mAP.\\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\\nand can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim-\\nits the number of nearby objects that our model can pre-\\ndict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in\\ngroups, such as ﬂocks of birds.\\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from\\ndata, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual\\naspect ratios or conﬁgurations. Our model also uses rela-\\ntively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since\\nour architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the\\ninput image.\\nFinally, while we train on a loss function that approxi-\\nmates detection performance, our loss function treats errors\\nthe same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding\\nboxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a\\nsmall error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.\\nOur main source of error is incorrect localizations.\\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision.\\nDetection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of\\nrobust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23],\\nHOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classiﬁers\\n[36, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 32] are used to identify\\nobjects in the feature space. These classiﬁers or localizers\\nare run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im-\\nage or on some subset of regions in the image [35, 15, 39].\\nWe compare the YOLO detection system to several top de-\\ntection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ-\\nences.\\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models\\n(DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection\\n[10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features,\\nclassify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring\\nregions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts\\nwith a single convolutional neural network. The network\\nperforms feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non-\\nmaximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur-\\nrently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea-\\ntures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our\\nuniﬁed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model\\nthan DPM.\\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in-\\nstead of sliding windows to ﬁnd objects in images.

Each stage of this\\ncomplex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently\\nand the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40\\nseconds per image at test time [14].\\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid\\ncell proposes potential bounding boxes and scores those\\nboxes using convolutional features. However, our system\\nputs spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which\\nhelps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our\\nsystem also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98\\nper image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search.\\nFinally, our system combines these individual components\\ninto a single, jointly optimized model.\\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on\\nspeeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa-\\ntion and using neural networks to propose regions instead\\nof Selective Search [14] [28]. While they offer speed and\\naccuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of\\nreal-time performance.\\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM\\npipeline [31] [38] [5]. They speed up HOG computation,\\nuse cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However,\\nonly 30Hz DPM [31] actually runs in real-time.\\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of\\na large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline\\nentirely and is fast by design.\\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be\\nhighly optimized since they have to deal with much less\\nvariation [37]. YOLO is a general purpose detector that\\nlearns to detect a variety of objects simultaneously.\\nDeep MultiBox. Unlike R-CNN, Szegedy et al. train a\\nconvolutional neural network to predict regions of interest\\n[8] instead of using Selective Search. MultiBox can also\\nperform single object detection by replacing the conﬁdence\\nprediction with a single class prediction. However, Multi-\\nBox cannot perform general object detection and is still just\\na piece in a larger detection pipeline, requiring further im-\\nage patch classiﬁcation. Both YOLO and MultiBox use a\\nconvolutional network to predict bounding boxes in an im-\\nage but YOLO is a complete detection system.\\nOverFeat. Sermanet et al. train a convolutional neural\\nnetwork to perform localization and adapt that localizer to\\nperform detection [32]. OverFeat efﬁciently performs slid-\\ning window detection but it is still a disjoint system. Over-\\nFeat optimizes for localization, not detection performance.\\nLike DPM, the localizer only sees local information when\\nmaking a prediction. OverFeat cannot reason about global\\ncontext and thus requires signiﬁcant post-processing to pro-\\nduce coherent detections.\\nMultiGrasp. Our work is similar in design to work on\\ngrasp detection by Redmon et al [27]. Our grid approach to\\nbounding box prediction is based on the MultiGrasp system\\nfor regression to grasps. However, grasp detection is a much\\nsimpler task than object detection. MultiGrasp only needs\\nto predict a single graspable region for an image containing\\none object. It doesn’t have to estimate the size, location,\\nor boundaries of the object or predict it’s class, only ﬁnd a\\nregion suitable for grasping. YOLO predicts both bounding\\nboxes and class probabilities for multiple objects of multi-\\nple classes in an image.\\n4. Experiments\\nFirst we compare YOLO with other real-time detection\\nsystems on PASCAL VOC 2007. To understand the differ-\\nences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the\\nerrors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one\\nof the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based\\non the different error proﬁles we show that YOLO can be\\nused to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er-\\nrors from background false positives, giving a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and\\ncompare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally,\\nwe show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than\\nother detectors on two artwork datasets.\\n4.1. Comparison to Other Real-Time Systems\\nMany research efforts in object detection focus on mak-\\ning standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [38] [31] [14] [17]\\n[28] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a de-\\ntection system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second\\nor better) [31]. We compare YOLO to their GPU imple-\\nmentation of DPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz.\\nWhile the other efforts don’t reach the real-time milestone\\nwe also compare their relative mAP and speed to examine\\nthe accuracy-performance tradeoffs available in object de-\\ntection systems.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on\\nPASCAL ; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object\\ndetector.

We compare YOLO to Fast R-\\nCNN since Fast R-CNN is one of the highest performing\\ndetectors on PASCAL and it’s detections are publicly avail-\\nable.\\nWe use the methodology and tools of Hoiem et al.

Fast R-CNN makes much fewer local-\\nization errors but far more background errors. 13.6% of\\nit’s top detections are false positives that don’t contain any\\nobjects. Fast R-CNN is almost 3x more likely to predict\\nbackground detections than YOLO.\\n4.3. Combining Fast R-CNN and YOLO\\nYOLO makes far fewer background mistakes than Fast\\nR-CNN. By using YOLO to eliminate background detec-\\ntions from Fast R-CNN we get a signiﬁcant boost in perfor-\\nmance. For every bounding box that R-CNN predicts we\\ncheck to see if YOLO predicts a similar box. If it does, we\\ngive that prediction a boost based on the probability pre-\\ndicted by YOLO and the overlap between the two boxes.\\nThe best Fast R-CNN model achieves a mAP of 71.8%\\non the VOC 2007 test set.

YOLO compared with the full comp4 (outside data allowed) public leaderboard as of\\nNovember 6th, 2015. Mean average precision and per-class average precision are shown for a variety of detection methods. YOLO is the\\nonly real-time detector. Fast R-CNN + YOLO is the forth highest scoring method, with a 2.3% boost over Fast R-CNN.\\nmAP increases by 3.2% to 75.0%. We also tried combining\\nthe top Fast R-CNN model with several other versions of\\nFast R-CNN. Those ensembles produced small increases in\\nmAP between .3 and .6%, see Table 2 for details.\\nThe boost from YOLO is not simply a byproduct of\\nmodel ensembling since there is little beneﬁt from combin-\\ning different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is precisely\\nbecause YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at test\\ntime that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s per-\\nformance.\\nUnfortunately, this combination doesn’t beneﬁt from the\\nspeed of YOLO since we run each model seperately and\\nthen combine the results. However, since YOLO is so fast\\nit doesn’t add any signiﬁcant computational time compared\\nto Fast R-CNN.\\n4.4. VOC 2012 Results\\nOn the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP.\\nThis is lower than the current state of the art, closer to\\nthe original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our sys-\\ntem struggles with small objects compared to its closest\\ncompetitors. On categories like bottle, sheep, and\\ntv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or\\nFeature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and\\ntrain YOLO achieves higher performance.\\nOur combined Fast R-CNN + YOLO model is one of the\\nhighest performing detection methods. Fast R-CNN gets\\na 2.3% improvement from the combination with YOLO,\\nboosting it 5 spots up on the public leaderboard.\\n4.5. Generalizability: Person Detection in Artwork\\nAcademic datasets for object detection draw the training\\nand testing data from the same distribution. In real-world\\napplications it is hard to predict all possible use cases and\\nthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be-\\nfore [3]. We compare YOLO to other detection systems on\\nthe Picasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], two\\ndatasets for testing person detection on artwork.\\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between\\nYOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give\\nVOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are\\ntrained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are\\ntrained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained\\non VOC 2010.\\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN\\ndrops off considerably when applied to artwork. R-CNN\\nuses Selective Search for bounding box proposals which is\\ntuned for natural images. The classiﬁer step in R-CNN only\\nsees small regions and needs good proposals.\\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork.\\nPrior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has\\nstrong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects.\\nThough DPM doesn’t degrade as much as R-CNN, it starts\\nfrom a lower AP.\\nYOLO has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP\\ndegrades less than other methods when applied to artwork.\\nLike DPM, YOLO models the size and shape of objects,\\nas well as relationships between objects and where objects\\ncommonly appear. Artwork and natural images are very\\ndifferent on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of\\nthe size and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict\\ngood bounding boxes and detections.\\n5. Real-Time Detection In The Wild\\nYOLO is a fast, accurate object detector, making it ideal\\nfor computer vision applications. We connect YOLO to a\\nwebcam and verify that it maintains real-time performance,'),\n",

YOLO also generalizes well to\\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\\nfast, robust object detection.\\nAcknowledgements: This work is partially supported by\\nONR N00014-13-1-0720, NSF IIS-1338054, and The Allen\\nDistinguished Investigator Award.'),\n",

This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words).

Our model is simple to construct and can be trained\\ndirectly on full images. Unlike classiﬁer-based approaches,\\nYOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds\\nto detection performance and the entire model is trained\\njointly.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec-\\ntor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in\\nreal-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to\\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\\nfast, robust object detection.\\nAcknowledgements: This work is partially supported by\\nONR N00014-13-1-0720, NSF IIS-1338054, and The Allen\\nDistinguished Investigator Award.'),\n",

This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words).

Our model is simple to construct and can be trained\\ndirectly on full images. Unlike classiﬁer-based approaches,\\nYOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds\\nto detection performance and the entire model is trained\\njointly.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec-\\ntor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in\\nreal-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to\\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\\nfast, robust object detection.\\nAcknowledgements: This work is partially supported by\\nONR N00014-13-1-0720, NSF IIS-1338054, and The Allen\\nDistinguished Investigator Award.'),\n",
